"""
	Module for specific text analysis
	More global aim would be to detect an attempt of: Ransom, Phishing, Social Engineering, etc.
	Here, only ENGLISH words, and related to Ransoms/Ransomwares are sought for now.
	When this module will run smoothly and give results, it'll be a good framework for other threatening Pastes (phishing, dox, skids, etc.)

	Module's format:
	- analyse whether the content is in natural human language ( <-- ignored, we actually check every Paste)
	- a file "AIL-framework/nltk_data/corpora/dict/ransom.dic" lists keywords and their (arbitrary) weight
	- keep a local var dict_ransom["word": weight]
	- tested texts are lowercased
	- compare the text and look for the keywords from "dict_ransom"
	- add the weight of those keywords in a "counter" variable (representing the probability of an actual threatining ransom)
	- lower the weight of repetitions (increase R times the counter, instead of R*W, for barely relevant occurrences; R=repeats; W=weight)
	- raise an alert only if the threat of an actual ransom message is higher than an (arbitrary) threshold
