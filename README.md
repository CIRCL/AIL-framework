AIL framework - Framework for Analysis of Information Leaks

AIL is a modular framework to analyse potential information leaks from unstructured data sources like pastes from Pastebin or similar services or unstructured data streams. AIL framework is flexible and can be extended to support other functionalities to mine sensitive information.

Features
--------

* Modular architecture to handle streams of unstructured or structured information
* Default support for external ZMQ feeds, such as provided by CIRCL or other providers
* Multiple feed support
* Each module can process and reprocess the information already processed by AIL
* Detecting and extracting URLs including their geographical location (e.g. IP address location)
* Extracting and validating potential leak of credit cards numbers, credentials, ...
* Extracting and validating email addresses leaked including DNS MX validation
* Module for extracting Tor .onion addresses (to be further processed for analysis)
* Keep tracks of duplicates
* Extracting and validating potential hostnames (e.g. to feed Passive DNS systems)
* A full-text indexer module to index unstructured information
* Statistics on modules and web
* Realtime modules manager in terminal
* Global sentiment analysis for each providers based on nltk vader module
* Terms, Set of terms and Regex tracking and occurrence
* Many more modules for extracting phone numbers, credentials and others

Installation
------------

Type these command lines for a fully automated installation and start AIL framework
```
git clone https://github.com/CIRCL/AIL-framework.git
cd AIL-framework
./installing_deps.sh
cd var/www/
./update_thirdparty.sh
cd ~/AIL-framework/
. ./AILENV/bin/activate
cd bin/
./LAUNCH.sh
```
The default [installing_deps.sh](./installing_deps.sh) is for Debian and Ubuntu based distributions. For Arch
linux based distributions, you can replace it with [installing_deps_archlinux.sh](./installing_deps_archlinux.sh).

There is also a [Travis file](.travis.yml) used for automating the installation that can be used to build and install AIL on other systems.

Docker Quick Start (Ubuntu 16.04 LTS)
------------
1. Install Docker
```
sudo su
apt-get install -y curl
curl https://get.docker.com | /bin/bash
```

2. Type these commands to build the Docker image:
```
git clone https://github.com/CIRCL/ail-framework
cd AIL-framework
docker build -t ail-framework
```
3. To start AIL on port 7000, type the following command below:
```
docker run -p 7000:7000 ail-framework
```

4. To debug the running container, type the following command and note the container name or identifier:
```
docker ps
```

After getting the name or identifier type the following commands:
```
docker exec -it CONTAINER_NAME_OR_IDENTIFIER bash
cd /opt/ail
```


Starting AIL web interface
--------------------------

To start the web interface, you first need to fetch the required Javascript/CSS files:

```
cd $AILENV
cd var/www/
bash update_thirdparty.sh
```

and then you can start the web interface python script:

```
cd $AILENV
cd var/www/
Flask_server.py
```

Eventually you can browse the status of the AIL framework website at the following URL:

        ``http://localhost:7000/``
