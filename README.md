AIL framework - Framework for Analysis of Information Leaks

AIL is a modular framework to analyse potential information leaks from unstructured data sources like pastes from Pastebin or similar services or unstructured data streams. AIL framework is flexible and can be extended to support other functionalities to mine or process sensitive information (e.g. data leak prevention).

Features
--------

* Modular architecture to handle streams of unstructured or structured information
* Default support for external ZMQ feeds, such as provided by CIRCL or other providers
* Multiple feed support
* Each module can process and reprocess the information already processed by AIL
* Detecting and extracting URLs including their geographical location (e.g. IP address location)
* Extracting and validating potential leak of credit cards numbers, credentials, ...
* Extracting and validating email addresses leaked including DNS MX validation
* Module for extracting Tor .onion addresses (to be further processed for analysis)
* Keep tracks of duplicates (and diffing between each duplicate found)
* Extracting and validating potential hostnames (e.g. to feed Passive DNS systems)
* A full-text indexer module to index unstructured information
* Statistics on modules and web
* Real-time modules manager in terminal
* Global sentiment analysis for each providers based on nltk vader module
* Terms, Set of terms and Regex tracking and occurrence
* Many more modules for extracting phone numbers, credentials and others
* Alerting to [MISP](https://github.com/MISP/MISP) to share found leaks within a threat intelligence platform using [MISP standard](https://www.misp-project.org/objects.html#_ail_leak)
* Detect and decode encoded file (Base64, hex encoded or your own decoding scheme) and store files
* Detect Amazon AWS and Google API keys
* Detect Bitcoin address and Bitcoin private keys
* Detect private keys, certificate, keys (including SSH, OpenVPN)
* Detect IBAN bank accounts
* Tagging system with [MISP Galaxy](https://github.com/MISP/misp-galaxy) and [MISP Taxonomies](https://github.com/MISP/misp-taxonomies) tags
* UI paste submission
* Create events on [MISP](https://github.com/MISP/MISP) and cases on [The Hive](https://github.com/TheHive-Project/TheHive)
* Automatic paste export at detection on [MISP](https://github.com/MISP/MISP) (events) and [The Hive](https://github.com/TheHive-Project/TheHive) (alerts) on selected tags
* Extracted and decoded files can be searched by date range, type of file (mime-type) and encoding discovered
* Graph relationships between decoded file (hashes)
* Tor hidden services crawler to crawl and parse output
* Tor onion availability is monitored to detect up and down of hidden services
* Browser hidden services are screenshot and integrated in the analysed output including a blurring screenshot interface (to avoid "burning the eyes" of the security analysis with specific content)
* Tor hidden services is part of the standard framework, all the AIL modules are available to the crawled hidden services


Installation
------------

Type these command lines for a fully automated installation and start AIL framework:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CIRCL/AIL-framework.git
cd AIL-framework
./installing_deps.sh
cd var/www/
./update_thirdparty.sh
cd ~/AIL-framework/
. ./AILENV/bin/activate
cd bin/
./LAUNCH.sh
```

The default [installing_deps.sh](./installing_deps.sh) is for Debian and Ubuntu based distributions. For Arch
linux based distributions, you can replace it with [installing_deps_archlinux.sh](./installing_deps_archlinux.sh).

There is also a [Travis file](.travis.yml) used for automating the installation that can be used to build and install AIL on other systems.

Installation Notes
------------

In order to use AIL combined with **ZFS** or **unprivileged LXC** it's necessary to disable Direct I/O in `$AIL_HOME/configs/6382.conf` by changing the value of the directive `use_direct_io_for_flush_and_compaction` to `false`.

Python 3 Upgrade
------------

To upgrade from an existing AIL installation, you have to launch [python3_upgrade.sh](./python3_upgrade.sh), this script will delete and create a new virtual environment. The script **will upgrade the packages but won't keep your previous data** (neverthless the data is copied into a directory called `old`). If you install from scratch, you don't require to launch the [python3_upgrade.sh](./python3_upgrade.sh).

Docker Quick Start (Ubuntu 16.04 LTS)
------------

1. Install Docker
```bash
sudo su
apt-get install -y curl
curl https://get.docker.com | /bin/bash
```

2. Type these commands to build the Docker image:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CIRCL/ail-framework
cd AIL-framework
docker build -t ail-framework .
```
3. To start AIL on port 7000, type the following command below:
```
docker run -p 7000:7000 ail-framework
```

4. To debug the running container, type the following command and note the container name or identifier:
```bash
docker ps
```

After getting the name or identifier type the following commands:
```bash
docker exec -it CONTAINER_NAME_OR_IDENTIFIER bash
cd /opt/ail
```

Install using Ansible
---------------------

Please check the [Ansible readme](ansible/README.md).

Starting AIL web interface
--------------------------

To start the web interface, you first need to fetch the required JavaScript/CSS files:

```bash
cd $AILENV
cd var/www/
bash update_thirdparty.sh
```

and then you can start the web interface python script:

```bash
cd $AILENV
cd var/www/
./Flask_server.py
```

Eventually you can browse the status of the AIL framework website at the following URL:

```
http://localhost:7000/
```

HOWTO
-----

HOWTO are available in [HOWTO.md](HOWTO.md)

Privacy and GDPR
----------------

[AIL information leaks analysis and the GDPR in the context of collection, analysis and sharing information leaks](https://www.circl.lu/assets/files/information-leaks-analysis-and-gdpr.pdf) document provides an overview how to use AIL in a lawfulness context especially in the scope of General Data Protection Regulation.
