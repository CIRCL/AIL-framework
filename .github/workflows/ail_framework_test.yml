# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run.
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the master branch
  push:
    branches: [ master, dev ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master, dev ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  ail_test:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # TODO: Matrix strategy for Python versions is defined but never used.
    # Currently all jobs use the same system Python, making this redundant.
    # Either add 'actions/setup-python' to use matrix.python-version, or remove the matrix.
    # 
    # To enable multi-version Python testing:
    # 
    # Step 1: Uncomment the matrix below (defines the Python versions to test):
    # strategy:
    #    matrix:
    #      python-version: ['3.7', '3.8', '3.9', '3.10']
    # 
    # Step 2: Add this step after checkout (before "Free up disk space"):
    #      - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    #        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
    #        with:
    #          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    # 
    # ORIGINAL (commented out - not used, makes tests 4x slower with no benefit):
    # strategy:
    #    matrix:
    #      python-version: ['3.7', '3.8', '3.9', '3.10']


    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
